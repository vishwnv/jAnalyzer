kevin has directed many movies in a good way. let's agree actors have done a tremendous job. acting of niel grass is remarkable. actions are well planed and very much likable. there is no thrilling moments in the plot. the story of this movie is very poor storywriting. furious7 movie review provides the core plot of the movie of james wan which is released in2017 in summer. vin diesel has firmly stated that this movie may earn a oscar for it's acting, maybe he's right because the acting is probably the best in the franchise. i have to say music is very evil in furious movies
